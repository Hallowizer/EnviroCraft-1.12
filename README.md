EnviroMine
==========
For information, please check [the wiki](https://github.com/EnviroMine/EnviroMine-1.7/wiki)
This is an unfinished port of environmine for 1.12 that will not be completed, at least not as one mod.

For similar mechanics to Environmine's modules check out:

Food Funk

[Github](https://github.com/Stormwind99/FoodFunk)
This mod is a port of Environmine's food rotting mechanic

Tough as Nails
[Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tough-as-nails)
[Github](https://github.com/Glitchfiend/ToughAsNails)
This mod adds thirst and temperature to minecraft. While it is officially not being developed anymore, it is 1.12.

Sadly, I could not find faithful reproductions of the following mechanics:

Sanity

Gases as an underground danger

Air Quality

Block Physics

In my own time I will see if I can replicate these mechanics, but it will be slow. Right now I'll be focusing on replicating Block Physics. I will update this read me as things change.
